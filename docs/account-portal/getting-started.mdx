# Getting Started with the Account Portal

To integrate the Account Portal into your application, simply mount the `<ClerkProvider />` to your application and protect your pages. Your users will then automatically redirected between your application and the Account Portal pages.

     **Dynamic Development Host Detection**  

     For development environments, the development host (e.g. http://localhost:3000) is dynamically detected by Clerk at runtime and tied to your client browser. We store this as the â€˜home originâ€™ for your application and it is equivalent to your application domain in production environments.

## Next.js
<Steps>


### Install `@clerk/nextjs`

Once you have a Next.js application ready, you need to install Clerk's Next.js SDK. This gives you access to prebuilt components and hooks, as well as [helpers](/docs/references/nextjs/overview) for Next.js API routes, server-side rendering, and middleware.

<CodeBlockTabs options={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  ```bash filename="terminal" copy
  npm install @clerk/nextjs
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal" copy
  yarn add @clerk/nextjs
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal" copy
  pnpm i @clerk/nextjs
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment keys

Below is an example of an `.env.local` file. If you are signed into your Clerk Dashboard, your keys should become visible by clicking on the eye icon.

<InjectKeys>

```sh copy filename=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
```

</InjectKeys>

### Mount `<ClerkProvider />`

Update your root layout to include the [`<ClerkProvider />`](/docs/components/clerk-provider#clerk-provider) wrapper. The `<ClerkProvider />` component wraps your Next.js application to provide active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components. It is recommended that the `<ClerkProvider />` wraps the `<body/>` to enable the context to be accessible anywhere within the app.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
```tsx copy filename="app/layout.tsx"
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Next.js 13 with Clerk',
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
      <html lang="en">
        <body>{children}</body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="_app.tsx" copy
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
export default MyApp;
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

<Callout type="warning">
  The root layout is a server component. If you plan to use the `<ClerkProvider />` outside the root layout, it will need to be a server component as well.
</Callout>

### Protect your application

Now that Clerk is installed and mounted in your application, itâ€™s time to decide which pages are public and which need to hide behind authentication. We do this by creating a `middleware.ts` file at the root folder (or inside `src/` if that is how you set up your app).

```tsx filename="middleware.ts" copy
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

// This example protects all routes including api/trpc routes
// Please edit this to allow other routes to be public as needed.
// See https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware for more information about configuring your middleware
export default authMiddleware({});

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.*\\..*|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
};

```

With this middleware, your entire application is protected. If you try to access it, the middleware will redirect you to your Sign Up page. If you want to make other routes public, check out the [authMiddleware reference page](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware).

    
### Optional: Use Control Components

If you are not using middleware or want to specify any specific situations on the frontend within a public page where you need to leverage the userâ€™s auth state, then you can also use our `<SignedOut />` and `<SignedIn />` control components along with `<RedirectToSignIn />` and `<RedirectToSignUp />` to redirect users accordingly.
  
    ```typescript filename="index.tsx" copy
    
    import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'
    import styles from '@/styles/Home.module.css'
    import { UserButton, SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut, RedirectToSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'
    
    const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })
    
    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <>
          <main className={`${styles.main} ${inter.className}`}>
    
            <SignedOut>
            <RedirectToSignIn/>
            </SignedOut>
    
            <SignedIn>
            <UserButton />
            </SignedIn>
    
          </main>
        </>
      )
    }
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
     In this example, we are using `<RedirectToSignIn />`, but you can also use `<RedirectToSignUp />` to take customers directly to the â€˜Sign Upâ€™ page.
    </Callout>

## React
### Install `@clerk/clerk-react`

Once you have a React application ready, you need to install Clerk's React SDK. This gives you access to our prebuilt components and hooks for React applications.

<CodeBlockTabs options={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  ```bash filename="terminal" copy
  npm install @clerk/clerk-react
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal" copy
  yarn add @clerk/clerk-react
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal" copy
  pnpm i @clerk/clerk-react
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment keys

Below is an example of an .env file. If you are signed into your Clerk Dashboard, your keys should become visible by clicking on the eye icon.

<InjectKeys>

```sh copy filename=".env"
REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
```

</InjectKeys>

### Configure `<ClerkProvider />`

Clerk requires your React application to be wrapped in the [`<ClerkProvider />`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component. The `<ClerkProvider />` component provides active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components.

```tsx filename="app.tsx" copy
import React from "react";
import "./App.css";
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

if (!process.env.REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
  throw new Error("Missing Publishable Key")
}
const clerkPubKey = process.env.REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY;

function App() {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={clerkPubKey}>
      <div>Hello from clerk</div>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Protecting your pages

Clerk offers Control Components that allow you to protect your pages. Below is an example using Clerk's hosted components and the `<SignedIn />` and `<SignedOut />` control components.

```tsx filename="app.tsx" copy
import React from "react";
import "./App.css";
import {
  ClerkProvider,
  SignedIn,
  SignedOut,
  UserButton,
  useUser,
  RedirectToSignIn,
} from "@clerk/clerk-react";

if (!process.env.REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
  throw "Missing Publishable Key"
}

const clerkPubKey = process.env.REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY;

function App() {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={clerkPubKey}>
      <SignedIn>
        <Welcome />
      </SignedIn>
      <SignedOut>
        <RedirectToSignIn />
      </SignedOut>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

function Welcome() {
  return <div>Hello you are signed in</div>;
}

export default App;
```
</Steps>

</Tab>
</Tabs>


Once this is set up, all you have to do is fire up your application. Clerk will automatically redirect your users to the Account Portal Sign In / Sign Up pages and back to your application  with an active session once they have successfully authenticated themselves.
