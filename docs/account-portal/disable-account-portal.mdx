# Disabling the Account Portal

A majority of our customers prefer to leave the Account Portal enabled, even if they are using their own embedded components / custom flows. This helps with testing as well as providing an alternative path for users when needed.

However, if you do want to disable it entirely, you may do so via the ‘danger’ tab in the dashboard. Please ensure that you set up your embedded components (or custom flows) via the instructions below first as this will applying this setting will immediately result in a 404 for all Account Portal pages.
