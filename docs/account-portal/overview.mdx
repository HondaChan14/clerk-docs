The Account Portal in Clerk is a powerful feature that allows you to streamline the sign-in, sign-up, and user profile management experience for your users, all while maintaining seamless integration with your application without having to build your own components or host your own pages.

# Why use the Account Portal?

The Account Portal provides all pages out of the box hosted on Clerk servers for you and requires minimal setup to get started, if youâ€™re looking for the fastest way to get your application up and running, then this is a great choice. 

However, if you require more precise customization or prefer having your application self-contained, then we would recommend using our embedded components or custom flows instead.

# How the Account Portal works

The Account Portal uses our Clerk components embedded on dedicated pages hosted for your application and users are automatically redirected to and from your application for a seamless authentication experience.

For each application environment, Clerk provides out-of-the-box pages including sign-up, sign-in, user profiles, organization profiles, and an organization creation flow.

For development environments, Clerk will issue you a randomly generated domain on "lcl.dev". In production, by default, the URLs for your Account Portal are the following:

```sh
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/sign-in
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/sign-up
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/user
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/organization
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/create-organization
```

You can access these links via the 'pages' tab under Account Portal in your Clerk dashboard.
