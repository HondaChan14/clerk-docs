The Account Portal in Clerk is a powerful feature that allows you to streamline the sign-in, sign-up, and user profile management experience for your users, all while maintaining seamless integration with your application without having to build your own components or host your own pages.

# Why use the Account Portal?

The Account Portal provides all pages out of the box hosted on Clerk servers for you and requires minimal setup to get started, if youâ€™re looking for the fastest way to get your application up and running, then this is a great choice. 

However, if you require more precise customization or prefer having your application self-contained, then we would recommend using our embedded components or custom flows instead.

# How the Account Portal works

The Account Portal uses our Clerk components embedded on dedicated pages hosted for your application and users are automatically redirected to and from your application for a seamless authentication experience.

For each application environment, Clerk provides out-of-the-box pages including sign-up, sign-in, user profiles, organization profiles, and an organization creation flow.

For development environments, Clerk will issue you a randomly generated domain on "lcl.dev". In production, by default, the URLs for your Account Portal are the following:

```sh
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/sign-in
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/sign-up
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/user
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/organization
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/create-organization

```

You can access these links via the 'pages' tab under Account Portal in your Clerk dashboard.

# Getting Started with the Account Portal

To integrate the Account Portal into your application, all you need to do is add the `<ClerksProvider />` to your application and protect your pages via Clerk Middleware OR by using our control components (`<RedirectToSignIn />` `<RedirectToSignUp />` )

- **Next.js**
    
    
    1. Wrap your app with `<ClerksProvider />`
    
<CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
```typescript filename="page/_app.tsx" copy

    import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs";
    import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
     
    function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </ClerkProvider>
      );
    }
```

```typescript filename="app/layout.tsx" copy   
    export default MyApp;
    import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
     
    export const metadata = {
      title: 'Next.js 13 with Clerk',
    }
     
    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode
    }) {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider>
          <html lang="en">
            <body>{children}</body>
          </html>
        </ClerkProvider>
      )
    } 
```
  </CodeBlockTabs>
    1. Specify your protected pages that will not require a user to be authenticated, all other pages in your application will require the user to be signed in.
    
    ```typescript filename="middleware.tsx" copy
    
    import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";
    
    // This example protects all routes including api/trpc routes
    // Please edit this to allow other routes to be public as needed.
    // See https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/middleware for more information about configuring your middleware
    
    export default authMiddleware({
    
        publicRoutes: ['/publicly-available-page'],
      });
    
    export const config = {
      matcher: ["/((?!.*\\..*|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
    };
    ```
    
    1. If you are not using middleware or want to specify any specific situations on the frontend within a public page where you need to leverage the userâ€™s auth state, then you can use our control components like so:
    
    ```typescript filename="index.tsx" copy
    
    import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'
    import styles from '@/styles/Home.module.css'
    import { UserButton, SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut, RedirectToSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'
    
    const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })
    
    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <>
          <main className={`${styles.main} ${inter.className}`}>
    
            <SignedOut>
            <RedirectToSignIn/>
            </SignedOut>
    
            <SignedIn>
            <UserButton />
            </SignedIn>
    
          </main>
        </>
      )
    }
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
     In this example, we are using <RedirectToSignIn />, but you can also use <RedirectToSignUp /> to take customers directly to the â€˜Sign Upâ€™ page.
    </Callout>

- **React**
    
    
    wrap your app with ClerkProvider and set the control components:
    
    ```javascript filename="app.js" copy
    import React from "react";
    import "./App.css";
    import {
      ClerkProvider,
      SignedIn,
      SignedOut,
      UserButton,
      RedirectToSignIn
    } from "@clerk/clerk-react";
    
    if (!process.env.REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
      throw "Missing Publishable Key"
    }
    
    const clerkPubKey = process.env.REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY;
    
    function App() {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider publishableKey={clerkPubKey} >
          <SignedIn>
    	      <Welcome />
          </SignedIn>
          <SignedOut>
            <RedirectToSignIn />
          </SignedOut>
        </ClerkProvider>
      );
    }
    
    function Welcome() {
      return <div>Hello you are signed in <UserButton /></div> ;
    }
    
    export default App;
    ```
    
- **ClerkJS**
    
    
    use the redirectTosignIn() function
    
    ```javascript filename="app.js" copy
    
    if (!Clerk.user) {
    	window.Clerk.redirectToSignIn();
    }
    
    ```
    

Once this is set up, all you have to do is fire up your application. Clerk will automatically redirect your users to the Account Portal Sign In / Sign Up pages and back to your application  with an active session once they have successfully authenticated themselves.

### Dynamic Development Host Detection

For development environments, the development host is dynamically detected at runtime. We tie it to your client browser and store it as the â€˜home originâ€™ for your application (e.g. localhost:3000). In production, we will use your application homepage as the â€˜home originâ€™.
